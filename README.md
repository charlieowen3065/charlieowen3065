Hello, I am Charlie Owen (@charlieowen3065) and am a current student at Purdue University pursuing my Master's Degree in Nuclear Engineering.

I work as a research assistant to Prof. Abdel-Khalik in the field of Nuclear Engineering. I specificaly do work in Powder-Bed Fusion 3D-Printing and work
with new imaging data from a full build. We are attempting to discover new correlations between this data and the mechanical property data we measured in 
some tests. We are utilizing machine learning alogorithms to do so to see if we can beter predict the mechanical properties and strength of printed objects
using this new set of data.
